R9.2 superclass and subclass

The small appliances such as toaster, car vacuum, and travel iron does not share a common characteristic, each of them has unique features and functionalities,
and creating a superclass and multiple subclasses without shared characteristics can lead to a needlessly complex class hierarchy. Thus we do not use a structure of superclass SmallAppliance and subclasses of Toaster, CarVacuum, TravelIron.

R9.4 SavingsAccount

Inherited methods
deposit(double amount)
getBalance()

Override methods
withdraw(double amount)
monthEnd()

Added methods
setInterestRate(double rate)

R9.6 Sandwich

a. legal because we assigned an instance of a subclass (Sub) to a reference of the superclass (Sandwich)
b. Not legal because we cannot assign an instance of the superclass (Sandwich) to a reference of the subclass (Sub) without casting.
c. Not legal because we cannot assign an instance of the superclass (Sandwich) to a reference of the subclass (Sub)
d. Legal because we can assign an instance of a subclass (Sub) to a reference of the superclass (Sandwich).

R9.7 Inheretence

located in _04interfaces folder called R9_7

R9.8 Inheretence -use the UML diagram tool in IntelliJ and indicate to the grader where uml file is located

located in _04interfaces folder called R9_8

R9.9 Inheretence -use the UML diagram tool in IntelliJ and indicate to the grader where uml file is located

located in _04interfaces folder called R9_9

R9.10 Casting

BankAccount (x) is an example of casting an object reference, but int (x) is an example of casting a numeric value.
The former one is used in the case when we cast a SavingsAccount object to a BankAccount reference.
The later one is used when we want to cast a floating point number to an integer.

c. false
d. true
e. false
